/// Immutable: update + delete both reject. To deprecate a group, stop
/// granting memberships and let existing ones expire.
///
/// ## Fields
///
/// - `hive_genesis_hash` — the parent hive. Binds the group into a hive
///   trust domain so the hive owner is sovereign over it. MUST resolve
///   to a real [`HiveGenesis`].
/// - `display_id` — human alias = the legacy humm-tauri group squuid
///   (continuity). NEVER security-load-bearing; routing/display only.
/// - `hive_wide_role` — `Some(role)` marks a hive-wide *system role
///   group* (the admin/writer/reader groups created at hive setup);
///   `None` marks an ordinary custom group. Load-bearing: a system role
///   group may only be created by the hive Owner; a custom group needs
///   hive Admin+.
/// - `creator_hive_membership_hash` — the creator's authorising
///   [`crate::hive::HiveMembership`] in `hive_genesis_hash`. `None` =
///   the creator IS the hive genesis author (implicit Owner). Persisted
///   so the create validator can re-walk hive authority.
/// - `created_at_microseconds` — informational only (UI ordering); not
///   compared against `action.timestamp` by any validator.

/// - `group_genesis_hash` — the group this grant applies in.
/// - `for_agent` — the grantee. May live in a *different hive* — the
///   field is just a holohash, which is what makes cross-hive group
///   membership (group chat across hives) representable.
/// - `role` — `Owner` / `Admin` / `Writer` / `Reader`.
/// - `grantor_membership_hash` — grantor's authorising
///   [`GroupMembership`] (Path C). `None` = grantor proved authority via
///   the group-author (Path A) or hive-sovereign (Path B) route.
/// - `grantor_hive_membership_hash` — grantor's authorising
///   [`crate::hive::HiveMembership`] in the group's parent hive (Path
///   B). `None` = not relying on a hive membership witness (uses Path A,
///   Path C, or the hive-genesis-author implicit-Owner case).
/// - `expiry` — `None` = permanent; `Some(ts)` = invalid once
