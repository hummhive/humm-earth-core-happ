# Holochain Development Skill

Expert assistant for Holochain hApp development. Covers the full development spiral: architecture, design, scaffolding, implementation, testing, and deployment.

## Proactive Invocation Rule

**Always invoke this skill in the PLAN phase** when the task touches a Holochain project. Do not wait to be asked explicitly.

Trigger conditions — any of these means the skill should be loaded before coding begins:
- Working directory is a Holochain project (contains `workdir/*.happ` or `dnas/*/zomes/`)
- Task involves `.rs` files inside `zomes/coordinator/` or `zomes/integrity/`
- Task involves entry types, link types, cross-DNA calls, or zome functions
- Task involves a PR on a Holochain project

When proactively invoked: load `Architecture.md` + `Patterns.md`, run the **ReviewZome** checklist against any files being modified, surface issues before implementation begins.

## Workflow Routing

| `Testing.md` | Four-layer strategy, Sweettest (Rust-native), E2E Playwright + AdminWebsocket, Wind-Tunnel performance |
| `WindTunnel.md` | Performance/load testing with wind-tunnel: ScenarioDefinitionBuilder, call_zome, ReportMetric, multi-agent roles, DHT sync lag measurement, InfluxDB metrics pipeline |

## Common Pitfalls Checklist

Run this against any zome code being written or reviewed. Each item is a class of bug that has burned projects before.

### Entry Schema Evolution
- [ ] **`#[serde(default)]` on new optional fields** — Any field added to an existing entry struct after initial deployment MUST have `#[serde(default)]`. Without it, existing entries serialized before the field existed will fail to deserialize. `Option<T>` alone is NOT sufficient.
  ```rust
  #[serde(default)]          // ← REQUIRED for fields added post-deployment
  pub new_field: Option<ActionHash>,
  ```

### Cross-DNA Calls
- [ ] **`ZomeCallResponse` is exhaustive** — HDK 0.6 has 5 variants: `Ok`, `Unauthorized`, `AuthenticationFailed`, `NetworkError`, `CountersigningSession`. Wildcard `_` is safe but hides new variants. Exhaustive match is preferred.
- [ ] **Role name matches `happ.yaml`** — `CallTargetCell::OtherRole("role_name")` must exactly match the role name in `workdir/happ.yaml`. Typos fail silently at runtime.
- [ ] **Zome name matches coordinator crate name** — `ZomeName("zome_name")` must match the coordinator's `name` in `Cargo.toml`. Check both.
- [ ] **Local mirror structs for cross-DNA types** — Avoid importing the remote DNA's Cargo crate. Define a local serialization mirror struct instead.

### Validation Rules
- [ ] **No DHT reads in `validate()`** — `validate()` must be deterministic. No `get()`, `get_links()`, `agent_info()`, `sys_time()`. Only inspect the op itself.
- [ ] **Use `op.flattened::<EntryTypes, LinkTypes>()`** — Not the old `op.to_type()`. Patterns.md has the correct pattern.

### HDK 0.6 API
- [ ] **`delete_link()` requires `GetOptions`** — `delete_link(hash, GetOptions::default())` not `delete_link(hash)`.
- [ ] **`get_links()` uses `LinkQuery::try_new()`** — Not `GetLinksInputBuilder` for most cases.
- [ ] **`GetStrategy::Local` vs `Network`** — Use `Local` for own-data queries (fast, no network), `Network` for DHT queries (cross-agent data).

### Shared Utility Patterns (project-specific)
- [ ] **`agent_pub_key` and `created_at` are NOT entry fields** — They live in the action header. Remove them from entry structs.
- [ ] **If using a shared utility crate** — verify intra-DNA and cross-DNA call helpers are used consistently rather than raw `call()` inline.

## Examples

**Example 1: Design a new entry type for a marketplace listing**
```
User: "I need to model a Listing entry with status transitions"
→ Loads Patterns.md (entry types, status enum, link types)
→ Designs ListingStatus enum (Active/Archived/Deleted)
→ Defines link types (AgentToListing, PathToListing, ListingUpdates)
→ Implements soft-delete via status field update, not entry deletion
```

**Example 2: Debug a cross-agent test that fails intermittently**
```
User: "My Sweettest passes alone but fails when another agent reads the entry"
→ Loads Testing.md
→ Identifies missing await_consistency call before cross-agent read
→ Adds await_consistency_60s([&alice, &bob]).await after Alice's create, before Bob's get
→ Test passes reliably
```

**Example 3: Scaffold a new hApp from scratch**
```
User: "Start a new Holochain project for a community coordination app"
→ Loads Scaffold.md + Workflows/Scaffold.md
→ If hc scaffold CLI is available: guides nix flake setup → hc scaffold happ → entry types
→ If no CLI (AI coding session): invokes Workflows/ManualScaffold.md → writes identical structure
→ Both paths produce the same standard hc scaffold architecture
→ Verifies compilation with hc s sandbox generate workdir/
```

**Example 4: Implement CRUD for a new zome**
```
User: "Implement a full resource zome with create, read, update, delete"
→ Loads Architecture.md + Patterns.md
→ Invokes Workflows/ImplementZome.md
→ Creates integrity crate (entry struct, link enum, validation)
→ Creates coordinator crate (create/read/update/delete functions)
→ Writes Sweettest tests at foundation + integration layers
```
